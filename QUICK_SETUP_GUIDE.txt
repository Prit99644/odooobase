## Step 1: Update Database (If Existing Installation)

### For EXISTING database (if hrms_db already created):

**Go to phpMyAdmin → Select hrms_db → SQL tab**

Paste and execute:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `company_logo` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL AFTER `company_name`;
```

### For NEW installation:
The `company_logo` column is already in the schema. No action needed.

---

## Step 2: Verify Directory Exists

**Check if this folder exists:**
```
c:\xampp\htdocs\hrms\assets\images\logos\
```

**If NOT, create it:**
1. Go to: `c:\xampp\htdocs\hrms\assets\images\`
2. Create new folder named: `logos`
3. Permissions: Make sure it's writable by web server (should be default)

The system will also create it automatically if needed.
