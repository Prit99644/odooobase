## Setup Required (One-Time)

### Step 1: Update Database (if you have existing HRMS)

**Go to phpMyAdmin → Select hrms_db → SQL tab**

Copy and paste this:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `company_logo` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL AFTER `company_name`;
```

Click: Execute

**If NEW installation:** Skip this - already included in schema

---

### Step 2: Verify Logo Directory

**Check if this folder exists:**
```
c:\xampp\htdocs\hrms\assets\images\logos\
```

**If YES:** You're good! System will save logos here.

**If NO:** Create it:
1. Open: `c:\xampp\htdocs\hrms\assets\images\`
2. Right-click → New Folder
3. Name: `logos`
4. Press Enter

Or the system will create it automatically when first logo is uploaded.

---

### Step 3: Test It

1. Go to: `http://localhost/hrms/`
2. Click: "Sign Up" 
3. Fill form:
   ```
   Company Name: My Test Company
   Company Logo: [Choose File] → Select any PNG/JPG image
   Admin Name: John Doe
   Email: john@test.com
   Password: Test123
   ```

## Logo Recommendations

### What Works Well ✓
- Company logo/brand mark
- Company initials with background
- Industry-specific icon
- Company symbol/mascot
- Text logo with company name

### Specifications
- Format: PNG (best) or JPG
- Size: 100 × 50 pixels (recommended)
- Max Size: 2 MB (enforced)
- Display: 40px height, auto-width

### What to Avoid ✗
- Photos (use logo instead)
- Very large files (> 1 MB)
- Very dark colors (hard to see on purple navbar)
- Text that's too small to read

---

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?

**1. Check directory exists:**
```
c:\xampp\htdocs\hrms\assets\images\logos\
Should exist and be empty initially
```

**2. Check logo uploaded:**
```
After registration, check folder has files like:
1704268800_CompanyName.png
```

**3. Check database:**
```
phpMyAdmin → hrms_db → users table
company_logo column should have path:
assets/images/logos/1704268800_CompanyName.png
```

**4. Clear cache:**
```
Browser: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (clear cache)
Reload: F5 or Ctrl+R
```

### Upload Fails?

**File too large:** Max 2MB (compress if needed)
**Wrong format:** Use PNG, JPG, or GIF only
**Directory issue:** Check assets/images/logos/ is writable
